# Example-of-a-Power-BI-report
Example of a Power bi report of made up data of countries meat import/export.
This data is made up by my teacher to exam the course "Self Service-BI" in the overall Data Science-education.

This report includes preprocessing of multiple excel-files, to split the data into FACT- and DIM-table, creating KPIs/metrics using Power query, and later on visualizing insights through different types of graphs, tables and gauge-diagrams.
